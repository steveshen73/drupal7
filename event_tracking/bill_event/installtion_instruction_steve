Calendar Configuration and Installation


Installation Successful

    The database has been created successfully and the default calendar
    settings have been saved in the table settings
    The LuxCal version number and the (encrypted) database credentials have
    been saved in the file lcaldbc.dat in the calendar root directory


Please note that it is good practice to directly . . .

- back up the database credentials file lcaldbc.dat in the root directory of the calendar

- delete the installation file install.php from the root directory of the calendar

Log in to the calendar, go to the administration menu (top right) and:

- on the Settings page set the timeZone to your local time zone

- on the Settings page choose your preferred settings

- on the Categories page define a number of useful event categories
