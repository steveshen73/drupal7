not be removed from the database. The Compact Database function will permanently 
remove events deleted more than 30 days ago from the database and free the space 
occupied by these events.</p>

<p>This function will create a backup of the full calendar database (tables, 
structure and contents) in .sql format. The backup will be saved in the 
<strong>files/</strong> directory with file name:
