To do list for next versions:
============================
1. Add admin setting to enable/disable "authentication required" for posting via 
   mini-calendar + make logging in / self-registering via mini-cal possible.
2. Add possibility to the user's page to select cats which the user may see.
3. Add drag and drop functionality (if feasible in HTML5)


Change log - version 2.7.1:
==========================
01. header1.php, headera.php, {most pages}.php: The Print button has moved to the 
    Navigation bar and can now be used to print any calendar page. When printing 
    a page, the page background color is set to white and undesired items, like 
    the navigation bar, buttons, scroll bars, notification messages, the 
    calendar footer, etc. are removed.
02. index.php, installation_guide.html: Ready for single sign-on (SSO). When the 
    calendar is embedded, users logged in on the parent website can be logged in 
    to the calendar automatically in a secure and easy way, using PHP sessions.
03. settings.php, ai-{lang}.php, retrieve.php, toolbox.php, notify.php, 
    event.php: A new admin setting has been added, to set the sender of reminder 
    emails to either the calendar mail address or to the mail address of the 
    user who created the event.
04. settings.php, lcmini.php, year.php, month.php, dw_functions.php: Two new 
    admin settings have been added to enable / disable the popping up of the 
    hover box with event details. One for Year, Month, Week and Day view in the 
    full size calendar and another for the mini calendar. Both are independent. 
    If the hover box is disabled, event details can still be viewed by clicking 
    the event title in the full size calendar or the event square in the mini 
    calendar.
05. lctheme.php, css.php: More user interface style definitions have been added 
    to the themes file giving the admin more possibilities to tailor the user 
    interface (e.g. today and selected date day cell, hover box for normal, 
    private and repeating events).
06. css.php, css_mini.php, lctheme_mini.php: The mini calendar now has its own 
    styles sheet and theme definition file. Consequently the mini calendar can 
    now be styled independently of the normal calendar.
07. general.js: The position of the log-in pop up window has moved from the 
    screen center to the more logical calendar window center.
08. retrieve.php: When event data was retrieved via a cron job and PHP sessions 
    were not active, a PHP warning message was produced. Solved.
09. dw_functions.php: In Week and Day view multiple events on the same day 
    showed only one of the events. This was a bug introduced in V2.7.0b.
10. notify.php, retrieve.php: Retrieving event data via a cron job, while PHP 
    sessions were not active, caused a PHP warning message (undefined variable: 
    _SESSION).
11. notify.php: Bug in passing of email list to sendMail function.
12. categories.php, users.php: PHP warning undefined variable $msg resolved.
13. css.php, header1.php: The height of all navigation bar items made identical.
14. general.php: In Chrome and Safari the hover box with event details only 
    showed the word "details". This was caused by the name "details" given to 
    the hover box and the meaning of <details>-tags introduced in HTML5.
15. login.php, ai{lang}.php: When the calendar has not been reloaded during the 
    lifetime of the PHP session and the user selects Log In, the Log In pop up 
    window remained empty. This has been fixed; now a message is displayed 
    asking to reload the calendar.
