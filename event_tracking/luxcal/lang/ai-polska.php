year should be sufficient.</p>

<p>When a user deletes an event, the event will be marked as 'deleted', but will 
not be removed from the database. The Compact Database function will permanently 
remove events deleted more than 30 days ago from the database and free the space 
occupied by these events.</p>
<h5>Backup database</h5>
<p>This function wil create a backup of the full calendar database (tables 
structure and contents) in .sql format. The backup will be saved in the 
<strong>files/</strong> directory with file name: 
<kbd>cal-backup-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.sql</kbd> (where 'yyyymmdd' = year, month, and 
day, and hhmmss = hour, minutes and seconds.</p>
